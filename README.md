LitePal? uses the ORM concept into android project.

You can use it to manager your tables in database without write even a SQL statement. All you need to do is define your model class, write the fields you need into class and put the class's full into mapping list. Then you can run your application, and everything about tables in database will be done automatically.

This is the magic created by Litepal. Enjoy it!!
